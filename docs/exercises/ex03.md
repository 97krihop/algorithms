# Exercise 03

Write a class called `OptimizedBubbleSort` with the following method:

`public <T> int sort(T[] array, Comparator<T> comparator, boolean optimized)`

The method should sort the input array based on a given `Comparator`.
The method should return the number of times the  method `Comparator#compare` is called.

If `optimized` is `true`, then instead of a naive bubble sort, you should run a better version.
For example, one fact that can be exploited is that, if the last swap is done at position `i`, then 
all elements after `i` are necessarily sorted. 
So, in the next iteration, you do not need to check elements after `i`.
 
 
Write a class called `OptimizedBubbleSortTest` in which you test your implementation.
You need at least one test with the following input array `["c", "b", "a", "d", "e", "f"]`.
On such array, you need to verify that your optimized bubble sort version should do less than
half the comparisons than a non-optimized version.
Note: be careful to do not call sorting twice on the same array, but rather create a new one.
