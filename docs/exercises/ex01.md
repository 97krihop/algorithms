# Exercise 01

Write a class called `MyArrayList` that extends `ArrayDeleteContainer`.

Override the method `add(T value)` in a way that, if the internal array is full,
then such array should be doubled in size before inserting the new element.

Write a test class called `MyArrayListTest` that extends `DeleteContainerTestTemplate`,
where the instance of `MyArrayList` is initialized with capacity of 1 
(i.e., the size for the internal array).
If your implementation of `MyArrayList#add` is correct, then all tests should pass.
