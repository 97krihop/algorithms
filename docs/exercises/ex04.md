# Exercise 04

Write a class `MixedSort` that extends `MySort`. It should implement a Merge Sort algorithm.
However, when recursively it arrives to sort a sub-section of the array with size less than
a certain threshold, eg `high - low < bubbleLimit` where `bubbleLimit` can be for example `4`,
then it should rather use a Bubble Sort to sort that subsection of the array.

Explain what might be the *possible* benefits of doing something like this.

Write a test class that extends `SortTestTemplate` to test if your `MixedSort` implementation is correct.
