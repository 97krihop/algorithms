# Exercise 04

## Part A

Write a class `MixedSort` that extends `MySort`. It should implement a Merge Sort algorithm.
However, when recursively it arrives to sort a sub-section of the array with size less than
a certain threshold, eg `high - low < bubbleLimit` where `bubbleLimit` can be for example `4`,
then it should rather use a Bubble Sort to sort that subsection of the array.

Explain what might be the *possible* benefits of doing something like this.

Write a test class that extends `SortTestTemplate` to test if your `MixedSort` implementation is correct.


## Part B

Study the source code of `InsertionSort`, `MergeSort` and `QuickSort`.
Once you think you fully understand them, write their implementation
on paper (e.g., using a pen), without looking at the source code.
Once done, compare what you wrote with the actual implementations. 

## Part C

Consider the following starting point for a Triangle Classification class:

```
public class TriangleClassification {

    public enum Classification {NOT_A_TRIANGLE, ISOSCELES, SCALENE, EQUILATERAL}

    public static Classification classify(int a, int b, int c) {
        return null;
    }
}
```

Without looking at the code of `TriangleClassification` from Exercise 01,
implement such function using TDD.
In particular, when doing TDD, use/write the following tests (each one should
be in its own `@Test` function), in sequence, one at a time:

* a negative `a<0` should result in `NOT_A_TRIANGLE`
* a negative `b<0` should result in `NOT_A_TRIANGLE`
* a negative `c<0` should result in `NOT_A_TRIANGLE`
* a zero `a==0` should result in `NOT_A_TRIANGLE`
* a zero `b==0` should result in `NOT_A_TRIANGLE`
* a zero `c==0` should result in `NOT_A_TRIANGLE`
* (-1,-1,-1), ie all -1s, should result in `NOT_A_TRIANGLE`
* (0,0,0), ie all 0s, should result in `NOT_A_TRIANGLE`
* (1,1,1), ie all 1s, should result in `EQUILATERAL`
* all edges being `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, ie (MAX,MAX,MAX), should result in `EQUILATERAL`
* (1,2,2) should result in `ISOSCELES`
* (2,1,2) should result in `ISOSCELES`
* (2,2,1) should result in `ISOSCELES`
* (5,2,2), ie too large `a`, should result in `NOT_A_TRIANGLE`
* (2,5,2), ie too large `b`, should result in `NOT_A_TRIANGLE`
* (2,2,5), ie too large `c`, should result in `NOT_A_TRIANGLE`
* (MAX-1,MAX,MAX) should result in `ISOSCELES`
* (MAX,MAX-1,MAX) should result in `ISOSCELES`
* (MAX,MAX,MAX-1) should result in `ISOSCELES`
* (2,3,4) should result in `SCALENE`
* (MAX,MAX-1,MAX-2) should result in `SCALENE`
